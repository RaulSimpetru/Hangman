# Hangman
One of my first Java games I made for my mother who works in an old people home.  
This hangman app is supposed to make the old people engage in mental activity by guessing the word.  
Also this game is in German but it is pretty easy to think what the word are supposed to mean.
# What I learned
- how to use pictures with a java panel
- how to take input and display it
- how to make a UI
