# Hangman
One of my first Java games I made for my mother who works in an old people's home.  
This hangman app is supposed to make the old people engage in mental activity by making them guess the word. 
Also, this game is in German but it is pretty easy to think what the words are supposed to mean.
# What I learned
- how to use pictures with a java panel
- how to take input and display it
- how to make a UI
